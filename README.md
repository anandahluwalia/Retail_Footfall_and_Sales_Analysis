# Morrisons Sales Analysis — Football Match Impact

This project analyzes supermarket sales data to explore how football match days affect customer footfall and sales performance.

Using real supermarket sales data (with simulated football match days), it includes:

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Adding football match day flags
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) by date, city, and product line
- Statistical A/B testing to check significance of match day effects
- Visualizations comparing sales and footfall on match vs non-match days

The goal is to demonstrate data-driven insights into retail patterns during sports events and showcase skills in data analysis, hypothesis testing, and visualization.
